## Code Structure

### Main Modules and Functions

#### `CamPlane` Class

- Represents a camera plane with a specific point, direction vector, and focal length.
- Normalizes the direction vector and calculates the camera plane point.

#### `CamSim` Function

- Simulates the projection of 3D points onto a 2D plane based on the camera plane.
- Transforms the object points relative to the camera plane.
- Plots the 2D projection of the 3D points.

#### `testCamSim` Function

- Calculates distances between transformed points and the camera plane point.

#### `ProjectEllipse2Cone` Function

- Projects an ellipse defined by its coefficients onto a cone.

#### `CheckCircle` Function

- Checks if the projected points satisfy the cone equation.

#### `plotSutface` Function

- Plots the surface defined by the cone equation.
